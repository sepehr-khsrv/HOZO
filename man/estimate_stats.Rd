\title{Estimate Statistical Parameters from Limited Data}
\usage{
estimate_stats(median, minimum, maximum, sample_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{median}{A numeric value representing the median of the sample.}

\item{minimum}{A numeric value representing the minimum observed value in the sample.}

\item{maximum}{A numeric value representing the maximum observed value in the sample.}

\item{sample_size}{A positive numeric value representing the size of the sample.}
}
\value{
A list with three named elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{mean}: The estimated mean of the sample.
\item \code{sd}: The estimated standard deviation of the sample.
\item \code{variance}: The estimated variance of the sample, calculated as the square of the standard deviation.
}
}
\description{
This function estimates the mean, standard deviation, and variance from the given median, minimum, maximum, and sample size using established statistical methods.
}
\details{
The function provides an approximation of the sample's mean, standard deviation, and variance when only the median, minimum, maximum, and sample size are known.
\itemize{
\item For larger sample sizes, the mean is assumed to be equal to the median.
\item For smaller sample sizes, adjustments are made to the mean using the minimum, maximum, and sample size.
\item The standard deviation is calculated differently depending on the sample size, with more reliable estimates for larger samples.
}

If the minimum and maximum are equal, the function assumes no variability in the data, returning a standard deviation and variance of zero.
}
\examples{
# A typical case with median 10, minimum 5, maximum 15, and sample size 30
estimate_stats(median = 10, minimum = 5, maximum = 15, sample_size = 30)

# Edge case where minimum equals maximum
estimate_stats(median = 20, minimum = 20, maximum = 20, sample_size = 10)
